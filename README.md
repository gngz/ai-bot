## Movement Heuristic Function


> With this heuristic function is possible make the robot be able to move with minimum number of steps and privilege the movement by the center when robot can't go by the shortest path. 


$`h(x) = a_0 * d(x) +  a_1 * c(x)`$ is the heuristic function.

$`d(x) = ABS(x_1 - x_2) + ABS(y_1 - y_2) `$ is the minimal number of steps between testing point and objective point.

$`c(x) = ABS(x_1 - 3,5) + ABS(y_1 - 3,5) - 1`$ is the minimal number of steps between testing point and nearest of 4 center points.

Testing Point $`= (x_1,y_1)`$

Objective Point $`= (x_2,y_2)`$

$`x`$ is the testing point variable.

$`a_0`$ is the d(x) weight. By default is 1,5.

$`a_1`$ is the c(x) weight. By default is 0,5.
